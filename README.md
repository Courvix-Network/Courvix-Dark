courvix-dark
============

This just extends Roundcube's [Elastic skin](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/tree/master/skins/elastic) with some dark theme colours.

## Credits
The whole css has been "borrowed" from [Skorpion/roundcube-elastic-dark](https://github.com/Skorpion/roundcube-elastic-dark) (with some small tweaks).

Thanks to Tom for his Elastic Dark modification, I used that as a base.
